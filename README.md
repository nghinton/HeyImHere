Hello!

Welcome to HeyImHere, my autonomous messaging application for Android! This is a personal project that started out as
a semester long group project that I completed with Richard Wiedenroth, Peyton Shotts, and Ze Miao for CS 495 at the 
University of Alabama in Spring 2020. Once that project was completed I took the parts I liked and created a simpler, 
cleaner app with the same name. The original project can be found here - https://github.com/PeytonShotts/HeyImHere

Feel free to play around with this if you like, its pretty basic but it should be functional and easy to read and look 
through if your doing something similar. 

Things that need work:

 - Unit testing still really needs to be fleshed out more.
 - Occasionally I get a null pointer exception from my alarm mamnager when it reads from the message reciever field
   I cant seem to reproduce it at will but the app works most of the time
 - The code needs to be prettied up in some spots, and the commenting could be more extensive
